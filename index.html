                As I close my eyes and breathe calmly, I feel peaceful inside. With each breath, I feel more sure of myself and fearless.
                I believe in my abilities and know I can handle any challenges that come my way. I spread happiness and love wherever I go.
                I am strong, and I can bounce back from anything tough.
